# Example-C-programs
A repository consisting of my first ever programs, done for practice, in C programming language

This repository contains the following programs:

quadratic.c - Drawing a graph of quadratic function - This program draws a graph of function
(in the region from x = -2 to x = 2) using "#" sign.
The user can enter 3 real numbers a, b, and c that make up the function y=ax^2+bx+c,
and the program returns the graph.

utrovacki.c - "Utrova훾ki" translator - Utrova훾ki iz a very specific type of slang in Serbian language,
in which words are changed according to a specific rule. First the word is split in two parts:
the first part consists of the first sylable, and the second part, the rest of the word.
Then "utrova훾ki" version of the word is composed according to the following rule: U + last part + ZA + first part + NJE.
So the word "pivo" (beer in Serbian) would become uvozapinje in utrova훾ki.
The program does this transformation automatically.

word_transformer.c - Word transformer - Another slang transformer, this one transforms wors like patike into papatipikepe,
that is, after each sylable it adds the letter "p" and repeats the vocal of that sylable.

eight_direction_star.c - Eight directions text star - This is a simple program, that writes the word you enter,
in all eight directions, starting from the center, and forming a star.

teleport.c - Teleport - An adventure game in which you can teleport between 9 cities in the world, while pursuing 2 possible goals:
arriving from Tokyo to Paris in least steps, or visiting all the cities at least once. The problem is that you can
teleport only to two most distant cities (with some exceptions). Also, you might, depending on your goal choice,
spend money to teleport, or earn score. The game keeps track of number of unique cities you visited, number of times
you visited each city, money, score and even kilometers traveled.

Website_Simulator.c - Website Simulator - A C program in which the functioning and looks of a small static website are fully simulated.
